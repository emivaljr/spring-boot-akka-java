#spring-boot-akka-java
## A web application involving Spring Boot and Akka using Java 8

----
## Preface

> As a beginner, I found integrating Akka with Spring's dependency injection a bit complex, especially if I am using Java. This application is a step forward to do the same but in a much simplified way (rather than using Spring Extension and ApplicationConfiguration codes). The application has been built using Gradle. To run it one has go inside "spring-boot-akka-java" folder and type "gradle bootRun". Then open the browser and type

    http://localhost:8080/task/distribute

>This will enter different Task objects into your database
